# CITS5505-Group10-Project
# TrainTogether

A full-stack fitness tracking web application built with Flask, designed to help users stay motivated and empowers users to log, track, and visualize their workout activities, while also socilize with each other.

It allows users to:
- Watch categorized **workout tutorial** videos (cardio & strength)

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ErqianChen/CITS5505-Group10-Project.git
   cd CITS5505-Group10-Project
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **(Optional) Initialize the database:**
   ```
   python init_db.py
   ```
   The database will be available as app.db.


5. **Run the application:**
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

6. **Run the tests:**

### Unit Tests

All Python unit tests are named `test_*.py` and are located in the project root or in the `tests/` directory.  
To run all unit tests, simply execute:

```bash
pytest
```

Or to run a specific test file:

```bash
pytest tests/test_example.py
```

### Selenium Tests

Selenium tests are used for automated end-to-end browser testing. Before running, make sure:

- Selenium and all dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- The appropriate WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver) is installed and available in your PATH

To run all Selenium tests:

```bash
pytest tests/selenium/
```

Or to run a specific Selenium test file:

```bash
pytest tests/selenium/test_login.py
```

**Note:**
- It is recommended to start the Flask application server (`python app.py`) before running Selenium tests.
- Selenium tests will open a browser window automatically. Please do not interact with the browser during the test.
